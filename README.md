# Hangman

This is a hangman game that can be played in the terminal for as long as the word list it. The game takes words from the word list at random and makes you guess a letter or word at a time. It's a direct copy of the actual "HANGMAN"! Hope you enjoy! (To clarify, I will most likely come back to upload more words to add to the word list as it's only over 100 as of now.)
